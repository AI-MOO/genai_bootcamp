      "Performance leap: TGI processes 3x more tokens, 13x faster than vLLM on long prompts. Zero config !\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3x more tokens.\n",
      "By reducing our memory footprint, we‚Äôre able to ingest many more tokens and more dynamically than before. A single L4 (24GB) can handle 30k tokens on llama 3.1-8B, while vLLM gets barely 10k. A lot of work went into reducing the footprint of the runtime and its effect are best seen on smaller constrained environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "13x faster\n",
      "On long prompts (200k+ tokens) conversation replies take 27.5s in vLLM, while it takes only 2s in TGI. How so ? We keep the initial conversation around, so when a new reply comes in, we can answer almost instantly. The overhead of the lookup is ~5us. Thanks @Dani√´l de Kok for the beast data structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zero config\n",
      "That‚Äôs it. Remove all the flags your are using and you‚Äôre likely to get the best performance. By evaluating the hardware and model, TGI carefully selects automatic values to give best performance. In production, we don‚Äôt have any flags anymore in our deployments. We kept all existing flags around, they may come in handy in niche scenarios.\n",
